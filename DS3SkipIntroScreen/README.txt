== Installing ==
 * Extract DINPUT8.dll to the DarkSoulsIII.exe directory. 
   E.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game".

== What is this? ==
The No-Logo mod is a (allowed for speedrunning) modification for Dark Souls III that completely removes the intro logo screens from the game.
These are the logos normally shown when first starting DS3 and after saving and quitting the game, every time.


== Supported Versions ==
v1.10
v1.09
v1.08
v1.04

== Help ==

Q: The intro logo screens are still showing
A: Either the modified DINPUT8.dll is not in the correct directory or you are playing an unsupported version of the game.
